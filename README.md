PQC_Frontend
============

A frontend application for interacting with the PQC (Postâ€‘Quantum Cryptography) backend. This app lets users submit data to the backend for encryption, decryption, view results, etc.

This project uses standard web frontend tools (JavaScript, Node/NPM, etc.), includes a `docker-compose.yml` for convenient local setup.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or newer recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A running PQC backend service (e.g. your C++ microservice) accessible via HTTP
- (Optional) Docker & Docker Compose if you want to run frontend with backend & IPFS together
- Access to IPFS / metadata backend if used

---

## Setup & Running Locally

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atharvagithub/PQC_Frontend.git
cd PQC_Frontend
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
_or_
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Configure environment variables

You may need to set backend URL (where your encryption/decryption API lives), e.g.:

```env
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:9000
```

If present, verify `.env` or config file.

4. Run development server

```bash
npm start
```
_or_
```bash
yarn start
```

This should launch the frontend app (often on `http://localhost:3000`).

---

## Docker / Docker Compose

There is a `docker-compose.yml` in the repo. To run frontend + backend (if backend is included) together:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This spins up the frontend container (and any other services defined) so you can access the app via browser at whatever port is declared (often `http://localhost:3000` or similar).

---

## How It Works / API Integration

- The frontend connects to the backend via REST endpoints (e.g. `/encrypt_data`, `/decrypt_data`) using fetch/Axios.
- The payloads are JSON, containing data or metadata needed for encryption & decryption (e.g. public key, ciphertext, etc).
- Upon encryption, the frontend displays returned metadata (iv, tag, kem_ciphertext, etc).
- For decryption, frontend sends necessary metadata + private key + maybe file/CID to backend and receives decrypted result.

---

## Tips for CORS & Networking

- Make sure the backend allows CORS from the frontend origin.
- If using Docker Compose, ensure frontend and backend are on same network, and that frontendâ€™s API URLs reference service names or mapped ports.
- Example: if backend runs in Docker as `pqc-service`, from frontend container use `http://pqc-service:9000`.

---

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` â€” start dev server
- `npm run build` â€” build production bundle
- Others as per `package.json` (lint, test, etc.)

---

## Easy Setup

- If you dont want to install everything seperatly then navigate to POC Frontend github link and clone the project
- https://github.com/atharvagithub/PQC_Frontend
- First run the frontend by enterring command "npm start"
- Second start the docker file by the command "docker compose up -d"
